# segmentation-and-classification-

## Unet-segmentation:
A python code based on Keras and TensorFlow, suitable for segmentation.  Input size of image, number of channels, number of classes all are possible to handle. Shearing, zooming, and horizontal flip as the most famous methods are considered for data augmentation.

## SVM-classification:
An algorithm which reads the images and pre process them as input data to the svm, with the labels, SVM is trained and validated.

## SVM-feature-based-classification:
Input data is an excel file of features, which the last column is related labels, the data is read, balances and split to train and test performance of SVM classifier on the extracted feature vector.
